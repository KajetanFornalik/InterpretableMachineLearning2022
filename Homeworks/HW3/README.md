Add your second homework to this folder.

Deadline 2021-04-21 EOD


Task:
For a selected data set (you can use data from your project or data from Homework 1) prepare a knitr/jupiter notebook with the following points.
Submit your results on GitHub to the directory Homeworks/HW3.

TODO:
1. For the selected data set, train a predictive model
2. for some selected observation from this dataset, calculate the model predictions for model (1)
3. for an observation selected in (2), calculate the decomposition of model prediction using LIME / live / lime / localModel or similar technique (packages for R: live, live, localModel, iml, packages for python: lime).
4. compare LIME decompositions for different observations in the dataset. How stable are these explanations?
5. train a second model (of any class, neural nets, linear, other boosting) and find an observation for which LIME attributions are different between the models
6. Comment on the results obtained in (4) and (5)


**Important note:**

The submitted homework should consist of two parts (try to render html file out of your jupiter notebook). 

The first part is the key results and comments from points 4,5. In this part **PLESE DO NOT SHOW ANY R/PYTHON CODES, RESULTS (IMAGES, COMMENTS) ONLY.**

The second part should start with the word Appendix or Załącznik and should include the reproducible R/PYTHON code used to implement points 1-5.

Such division 1. will make these homework more readable, 2. will create good habits related to reporting.
